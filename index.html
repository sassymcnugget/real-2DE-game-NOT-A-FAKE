    <h1>WELCOME LOSER!</h1>
      <article>
        Greetings adventurer! You've suddenly found yourself far away from your home in the south east of the kingdom!
        Now you have no choice but to brave your way through the wastelands to hopefully make it back home.
        Oh, did we mention you're the crown prince and need to get home for your coronation? Yeah, that's a bit important.
        Keep safe from the monsters that will try to kill you. 
        Also have fun :^)

      using the arrow or wasd keys on your keyboard, move your lost hero around the board so he can find his way home.
      Be wary of enemies as some are stronger than others! If you find yourself in a fight you can't win, running
      is an option (but only loser run ayy lmao)

      As our hero found his way finally back home, he was crowned not prince, but as king as his father had passed in the time
      he had been away. Because of his peaceful nature and refusal to attack even the most frightening of opponents while outside
      the kingdom, he brought an end to his father's more warmonger-y ways and the once battle-hungry kingdom became peaceful for 
      the first time in its history. However, this left them open for attack and only so many moons later they found themselves
      wishing for the war-hungry king of past...
