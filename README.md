# real-2DE-game-NOT-A-FAKE
The basis for this game is as follows:

The character is placed onto a grid system with the goal of reaching the end of the map
With each step, there is a 30% chance of running into a random battle
Once the player has reached the end of the game or died, they are given one of 3 endings available.

Why I made the game:
JRPGs have always been a passion of mine and the ability to make an old-school style jrpg overworld was an exciting idea,
though admittedly more difficult that my smooth brain assumed it would be.

User Story:
The user is on a grid and can't see where to go. He is able to go around, but is faced with battled at 1/3 chance.
He's going around the board trying to find the end.
During battle, the user is lookin at what has the best damage output against each enemy. As each enemy has differing stats,
he will try both magic and attack to gague and see what works best for each enemy. Upon finishing the game, he'll be rewarded
with an ending and a chance to replay the game.

Wireframe:

-Grid system RPG
- there's a % chance for random encounters

Battles include:
-battle
-magic attack
-run

3 Possible Endings:
-Warlord
-Peaceful Ruler
-Dead/Try Again

Possibly use animate.css as design

User Experiencne:
They start on a start screen, after selecting start, they are greeted to a grid system with their character with the object to
to make it to the end. With each move, there is a 30% chance to enter a battle. Once done, the end screen is shown.

Approach:
Pseudo-psuedo coded the 4 main areas of the project.
With each area, I then pseudo coded to make it fully functional before going on to the next area
After fully coded, I added in the less-needed features
After adding those features, I added more aesthetics to the game
After that, added the least-needed features

Unsolved Problems:
-Being able to easily increase or decrease the grid size
-cloud overlay over the start screen

Technology Used:
HTML CSS JS
